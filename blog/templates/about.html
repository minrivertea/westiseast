<p>My name is Chris West! I'm a tea entrepreneur and owner of <a href="http://www.minrivertea.com">Min River Tea </a>, where I specialise in selling exceptional Chinese teas from my home in Fuzhou, China. This blog is a personal space where I write about life as a foreigner in China, kung fu, photography, programming and business.</p>

<h3>Why am I in China?</h3>

<p>I first got interested in China and Chinese culture after studying martial arts with the <a href="http://www.fwckungfu.com">Fujian White Crane</a> kung fu club. I travelled to China with a martial arts research group about 6 times between 2004-2006, taking over 30,000 photographs and hours of videos of authentic, traditional martial arts. After a few years, I decided to move to China, learn the language and extend my knowledge of this beautiful country.</p>
